# SpriteColourSwitcher
Takes an RGB value and replaces all instances of that value in the images inside the target folder. 
Outputs a new file with the prefix "modified_".

## How to use
Run the file, if the current directory is the one with the images to modify, hit enter, if not specify the directory of the images. 
Enter the colour to seek, and then the colour to replace it with.
A debug file will be created upon completion.

### WARNING: 
this will just do the replacements and create the new files without asking anything once the colours have been specified.
