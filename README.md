# Pixel Colour Switcher
Takes an RGB value and replaces all instances of that value in the images inside the target folder.<br> 
Outputs a new file with the prefix "modified_".

## How to use
Run the file, if the current directory is the one with the images to modify, hit enter, if not specify the directory of the images.<br> 
Enter the colour to seek, and then the colour to replace it with.<br>
A debug file will be created upon completion.<br>

### WARNING: 
this will just do the replacements and create the new files without asking anything once the colours have been specified.
